                    Nicole Stawikowski is a Toronto-based actor with a fondness for 80s music and the words of Esther Perel. 
                    She completed her Honours Bachelor of Arts in English Literature at the University of Toronto and swiftly realized that though the scent of used paperback fiction was mildly intoxicating, telling stories through film was much more enticing and fulfilling. 
                    Soon thereafter, she began gaining experience in Toronto-based independent productions including Mika Rekai and Aaron Hall's webseries "AntiSocial" and Andrea Marcelino's "I Did". 
                    She has since appeared various episodics, such as Our House Media's "Haunted Case Files" and Investigation Discovery's "Murder Board". 
                    She also led the cast of Georige Luttrell's "Hail Seitan", an Official Selection of the Toronto Lift-Off Film Festival 2020. 
                    You can catch her battling demonic spirits in Netflix's "Paranormal Survivor" and soon you'll be able to see her in Carlo Liconti's "The Apprentice".
